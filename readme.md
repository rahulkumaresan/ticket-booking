An online ticket booking portal has become a "must-have" facility for holding any ticketed event and movie shows are no exception, in fact a ticketing portal for a movie theater is more important than it is for anything else. Therefore, we intend to design and develop an online ticket booking application that will not only save the theatre management a lot of laborious effort but also enable moviegoers to book tickets from anywhere, without having to wait in queues at the booking counter.
